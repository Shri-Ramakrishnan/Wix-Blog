    <h2><b> What is a website layout?</b></h2>
    <p>A website layout is the arrangement of all visual elements on a webpage. Through the intentional positioning of page elements, we can control the relationship between them to better guide the user experience.<br> <br>
Acting as a key component of web design, a layout determines the sequence in which page elements are registered among visitors, which elements draw the most attention, and the visual overall balance of the site. Because of its visual significance, a website layout can enhance a websiteâ€™s message and usability.<br><br>
Did you know that nearly all first impressionsâ€”94%, to be exactâ€”are shaped by a websiteâ€™s design? This just goes to show how much your layout influences how visitors perceive and interact with your site. Put plainly, a good website layout can lead visitorsâ€™ focus in the right directionâ€”gravitating them toward what matters most first, and then continue to the following sections in order of significance. A layout can also be used to enhance your design, create interesting interactions and show that youâ€™re up-to-date with web design trends. </p>
  <h2><b>How to choose the right website layout </b></h2>
  <p>When approaching the task of choosing a website layout, there are two main factors to take into account.</p>
  <h3><b>Accommodate your content</b></h3>
 <p>The layout you choose should be fitting for your type of content. Why? A website layout needs to help tell the story you wish to deliver to visitors.<br> <br>"[Observe] the balance of text versus images on any given page," writes Wix Template Designer Kobi Michaeli in his guide for selecting the right layout. "Some homepage designs are very design-heavy. Theyâ€™re only meant to include a few lines of text next to a large, full-scale image. Forcing more text into these areas could throw off the balance of the whole page if youâ€™re not careful.<br><br> "As another example, letâ€™s say youâ€™re working with a template that has big text blocks and proportionately small images. If you end up writing minimal content or adding large images in spaces better suited for icons, then things can start looking awkward.<br><br>"Some types of website layouts are best used for showcasing products or works, making them more suitable for an eCommerce website or portfolio websites. Others convey factual information quickly and efficiently, and might work better for creating a blog or news platform.

    <h1>Use common layouts</h1>

    <p>
        While thereâ€™s room for creativity, the most well-known, tried-and-tested website layouts are usually the best option. These classic layouts tend to feel familiar to users, as they build on existing expectations, past experiences and the principles of design.
    </p>

    <p>
        Itâ€™s also worth considering some more general and commonly respected design principle is often applied to website design and is especially relevant when it comes to the design of website layouts. This is because how elements are grouped, in order to create a positive user experience, lies at the heart of Gestalt theory. The main principles are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements that belong together, such as menu and navigation bar, should be grouped together for usability.</li>
        <li><strong>Similarity:</strong> Elements that look the same and behave the same should also be positioned together.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> This focuses on providing an easy flow for users through a webpage through continuity between elements. One way to do this could be by implementing pagination.</li>
        <li><strong>Closure:</strong> This means users are not left with nowhere to go, or without another element to lead them through a page. Overlapping images are a good example of closure applied to a website layout.</li>
        <li><strong>Figure-ground related:</strong> Making sure the main elements of the site layout stand out from the background.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        You might also want to consider applying the <strong>rule of thirds</strong> to your website layout. This is a fundamental principle in photography and visual composition. It suggests dividing an image into a grid of nine equal parts by drawing two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines, resulting in four intersecting points. It encourages designers to place key elements of interest along these lines or at the points of intersection. The idea is that by doing so, the composition becomes more visually appealing and balanced, as it avoids placing the subject or important elements directly in the center of the frame.

        Since a familiar layout will result in a more intuitive, easy-to-use interface, weâ€™ve highlighted 10 of the most effective layouts below. Weâ€™ll explain what makes them work and which type of website is the best fit for each.
